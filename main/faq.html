  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <div class="faqc">
    <p><strong>1. What is DermScale?</strong><br>
      <br>DermScale is a web-based platform that utilizes machine learning technology to classify various skin diseases and conditions. It provides users with a convenient tool for assessing their skin health and seeking guidance on potential diagnoses.</br></br>
      <strong>2. How does DermScale work?</strong><br>
      <br>DermScale employs advanced machine learning algorithms trained on dermatology datasets to analyze input data, such as symptoms and skin characteristics as numerical values ranging from 0 to 3 (from moderate to severe) , and classify skin conditions accordingly. Users can input relevant information and receive predicted diagnoses based on the model's analysis.</br></br>  
      <strong>3. Is DermScale accurate?</strong><br>
      <br>While DermScale strives for accuracy, it's essential to understand that no diagnostic tool, including machine learning models, can replace professional medical advice. DermScale serves as a complementary tool for preliminary assessment and guidance but should not be used as a substitute for consulting a dermatologist or healthcare provider.</br></br>
      <strong>4. How can I use DermScale?</strong><br>
      <br>Using DermScale is simple and intuitive. Users can navigate to the platform's website, input relevant information about their symptoms and skin characteristics, and submit the data for analysis. The platform will then provide predicted diagnoses based on the input data.</br></br> 
      <strong>5. What skin conditions can DermScale identify?</strong><br>
      <br>DermScale is designed to classify a wide range of skin diseases and conditions, including but not limited to dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, acne, fungal infections, and various types of skin cancer.</br></br> 
      <strong>6. Is DermScale suitable for diagnosis?</strong><br>
      <br>While DermScale can provide valuable insights and guidance, it's important to remember that it is not a diagnostic tool in the medical sense. The platform's predictions are based on statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms and should be interpreted with caution. Users are encouraged to consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations.</br></br> 
      <strong>7. What skin diseases are covered by DermScale?</strong><br>
      <br>DermScale is designed to classify various skin diseases and conditions included in the Dermatology dataset. This includes but is not limited to dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, and other dermatological conditions.</br></br>
      <strong>8. Can DermScale identify rare or uncommon skin diseases?</strong>
      <br>DermScale's classification capabilities are based on the data available in the Dermatology dataset. While the dataset covers a wide range of skin diseases, including some less common conditions, the platform's ability to identify rare or uncommon diseases may be limited by the dataset's scope.</br></br> 
      <strong>9. Is DermScale suitable for use by healthcare professionals?</strong><br>
      <br>DermScale is primarily intended for use by individuals seeking preliminary assessment of their skin health. While healthcare professionals may find DermScale's predictions informative, it is not a substitute for clinical judgment or professional medical diagnosis.</br></br>
      <strong>10. How can I interpret the class labels (0, 1, 2) in the Dermatology dataset?</strong><br>
      <br>The class labels in the Dermatology dataset (0, 1, 2) represent different categories or types of skin diseases. Each label corresponds to a specific diagnosis or condition, as outlined in the dataset's documentation or metadata. For accurate interpretation, refer to the class mapping provided with the dataset.</br></br>
      <strong>11. Are there specific symptoms or characteristics associated with each skin disease in the dataset?</strong><br>
      <br>Yes, each skin disease in the Dermatology dataset is associated with a set of symptoms, characteristics, and clinical features. These may include factors such as the appearance of skin lesions, the presence of itching or pain, the distribution of rashes, and other relevant clinical findings.</br></br>
